## Projects

## The Geometer’s Sketchpad

The Geometer's Sketchpad</a></span> is an interactive Dynamic Geometry™ application, available for Windows, Mac, and iOS. I worked on the most recent major version, coding considerable portions of the Windows front end, also implementing core geometric and utility algorithms. I am also the tech lead for the development of an HTML5/JavaScript viewer for Sketchpad documents.

## Fathom

Fathom was a Dynamic Mathematics application for teaching Data Analysis and Statistics, available for Windows and Mac. I coded using an in-house cross-platform C++ framework, including HTTP download components, and mathematical algorithms (such as multiple linear regression, and primality testing).
